# Athlete-Analysis
Analysis for Jacklynn Willert


This project uses data taken from IJM's Salesforce, DonorSearch, and Spotrac (https://github.com/internationaljusticemission/athlete-influencer).

The data was used to look for seasonality in athlete giving and find high quality leads within our database.

The script 'Athlete Analysis.py' uses a predictive model based on past giving to find the current non-donor athletes who are most likely to give in the future.

These files are then used as datasources for the 'Athlete and Influencer.twb' Tableau workbook.
